The application allows users to input a word or phrase in a text entry field. When the user clicks the "Correction" button, the application uses TextBlob to analyze the input and provide a corrected version of the text, which is displayed in a second text entry field. There is also a "Clear" button that resets both input and output fields.

**Components:**
Tkinter GUI: The application creates a window with a title, labels, entry fields, and buttons arranged in a grid layout.
TextBlob: This library is used to perform spell checking and correction on the input text.
User Interaction: Users can type a potentially misspelled word, click the "Correction" button to see the corrected version, and use the "Clear" button to reset the fields for new input.

**Use Case:**
This application is useful for anyone needing quick spell-checking capabilities, such as students, writers, or anyone working with text.
